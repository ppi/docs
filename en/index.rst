PPI Framework
=============

PPI is a framework delivery engine. Using the concept of microservices, it lets you choose which parts of frameworks you wish to use on a per-feature basis. As such each feature makes its own independent decisions, allowing you to pick the best tools from the best PHP frameworks

PPI bootstraps framework components for you from the top frameworks such as `ZendFramework2`_,  `Symfony2`_, `Laravel4`_, `Doctrine2`_


In 7 short chapters (or less!) learn how to use PPI2 for your web projects.
